            <p>I have so much to tell you and share with you about life but more importantly, my wish is that you feel loved everyday.</p>

<p>Right now your mother is 32 weeks pregnant with you and your mom tells me you kick a lot. I am starting to feel it more and more!</p>

<p><em>Before I shaped you in the womb, I knew all about you. Before you saw the light of day, I had holy plans for you. - Jeremiah 1:5</em></p>

<p>First, I am your dad and my name is Ryan. I am 29 years old and I like music, sports and laughing. Your mom is Justine and she is the most amazing person we know. She is incredibly caring and loving. Your mom is the love of my life.</p>

<p>You have a big brother, his name is Jacks. He is pretty awesome too. He likes sports, cupcakes, and animals. Someday I hope that  you will look up to him and be happy to call him your brother and friend. 
<img src="/assets/images/welcome.png" alt="Welcome to the family!" /></p>

<p>Our dog is Ellie, she’s full of energy and extremely loving.</p>

<p>I want you to know that you are welcomed into a home that is full of love and happiness.</p>

<p><em>Every good and perfect gift is from above - James 1:17</em></p>

<p><strong>I promise to you:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>I will be there for you no matter what</li>
  <li>I will love you everyday</li>
  <li>I will help you in whatever way I can</li>
  <li>I will laugh with you</li>
  <li>I will be a positive influence on your life</li>
  <li>I will be honest with you</li>
  <li>I will celebrate your successes with you</li>
  <li>I will be there to help you through your struggles</li>
  <li>I will be involved in what you’re interested in</li>
  <li>I will be a Christian and raise you in a Christian home with Christian values</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>My hopes for you are:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>I hope you are happy and healthy everyday</li>
  <li>I hope you smile a lot</li>
  <li>I hope you love this life you are blessed with</li>
  <li>I hope you have a drive inside to work for what you want</li>
  <li>I hope you find love. Your mom is pretty amazing</li>
  <li>I hope we can be friends</li>
  <li>I hope you can talk to me about anything</li>
  <li>I hope that you help other people and allocate time and money towards helping and giving</li>
  <li>I hope you follow God’s plan for your life. It will be much better than the plan you have for yourself</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve been here for 28 years and I don’t know everything about life. I’m hoping that you can teach me more about life and we can help each other along the way.</p>

<p>Here are some things I have learned about life so far:</p>

<p>It’s the people that make life great. Get to know as many as you can. Laugh often, learn from them, everybody has a different story. Ask more questions than provide answers and have fun along the way! Life’s too short not to have a good time (be smart about it.) Remember the stories and tell them often. Surround yourself with great people.</p>

<p><em>As iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another. - Proverbs 27:17</em></p>

<p>Don’t let the outside world determine success for you. Only you can determine what success means for you. To me, success and happiness go hand in hand. Your mother and I will do everything in our power to help you with this.</p>

<p><em>Be on your guard; stand firm in the faith; be men of courage; be strong. - 1 Corinthians 16:13</em></p>

<p>Music is truly a gift from God.. The louder the better. There is something special about music. Listen to it often and don’t be afraid to listen to something new.</p>

<p>Healthy living is the best way to a clear mind and a more enjoyable way of life.</p>

<p>Enjoy the outdoors.</p>

<p>Don’t be lazy! Wake up every day determined and go to bed satisfied. Work hard in everything you do. Be the best at EVERYTHING you do, be gracious in winning humble in defeat. Do stuff that challenges you mentally and physically. It’s ok to fail, but learn from your failures.</p>

<p><em>Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters. - Colossians 3:23</em>
<em>Whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.1 Cor. 10:31</em></p>

<p>It the end of a hard day’s work take a minute to enjoy what you have accomplished. There is always pride in knowing you did everything you could. Enjoy that moment.</p>

<p>There are challenges and adversity in life. Everybody has them, what separates you from everybody else is how you deal with these times. See these as times of growth and opportunity. Never forget your times of adversity</p>

<p><em>Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds, knowing that the testing of your faith produces endurance. And let endurance have its perfect result, so that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.- James 1:2 - 4</em></p>

<p>Addison Marley McKinnon I want you to know that you are loved and you will always be loved. Your mom and I pray for your well being everyday. In this life we want you to be healthy and happy. We promise to be there with you and never forget there is a God who has a special plan for your life!</p>

<p><em>For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. - Jeremiah 29:11</em></p>

<p>Love,</p>

<p>Dad</p>
