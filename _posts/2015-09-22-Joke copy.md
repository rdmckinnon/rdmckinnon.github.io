There is a viking ship with all the men rowing down below.

The first mate comes down and says "Men, I have good news and bad news. The good news is tonight we are having fillet mignon for dinner and double portions for everyone!"

One of the men says whats the bad news?


"The captain wants to water ski after dinner."
