Hi Citrix!

Thanks for checking this page out. I really believe I would be an asset as your Training Specialist. Working for the past 7+ years as a franchisor I have really learned support and training. As Director of Internet Marketing, I would develop a plan, educate the network, train the network and support the network in the implementation of that plan. We have seen some great results. 

I'd love the chance to interview for the role!
