Dear future Ryan, 

One day when you are stressed and life is overwhelming take a second, take a deep breath, and remember these shoes. 

These shoes are Jacks’ first running shoes.  In these shoes Jacks learned to run. In these shoes he swung his first golf club. In these shoes he went to his first day of preschool. In these shoes we ran around the yard until we fell to the grass laughing. In these shoes we traveled 16 hours on a red eye from Hawaii to Raleigh. 

These are your favorite shoes and they are not even your shoes. 

Today is the last day Jacks' wore these shoes. He out grew them. Tomorrow we are washing these shoes and giving them away so they can be another father’s favorite shoes.
