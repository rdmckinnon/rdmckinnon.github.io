Hi Chewy!

I have been following your growth for a couple years now and I think my skill set could be a tremendous asset to your team. In the winter I applied for your SEM Analyst position and made it to the second phone interview. Well, I'm back and I'm trying my luck the the Director of Digital and Customer Acquisition Marketing position.

With my skill set, I believe this might be a perfect match. In 2012, I switched from the Internet Technology team and created the Internet Marketing department at my current company. Since then, our department has grown into a vital and profitable asset for the company. I am proud of the growth and work that we have done.  

I believe I can help Chewy optimize and manage campaigns and collaborate on future campaigns. 

I love your company atmosphere and look forward to hearing from you soon!
