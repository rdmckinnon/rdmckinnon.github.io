title: About me

Part time nerd full time dad. 

Internet marketing, website development, and small business infrastructure are all the biggest words I know. I love my family, I love being outside, I love taking pictures, and I love to travel. I used to be a golfer, then life happened. Iâ€™ll probably laugh the hardest at my own jokes.
